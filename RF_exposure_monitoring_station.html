							<h2>RF Exposure Monitoring Station</h2>
						</header>
						<p>
                            As part of my final year project, I was tasked with designing and manufacturing a low cost radio frequency (RF) exposure monitoring
                            station that can be located on a rooftop environment to continuously measure RF expsoure on the site to ensure that these RF emissions
                            are compliant with all safety standards for human exposure as defined in the ICNIRP standard.
                            Furthermore, the data pertaining to this RF emission was to be sent to a cloud-hosted time-series database where it can be furher analysed
                            and displayed on a browser-based dashboard.

                        <p>
                            The design was followed by a meticulous process of calibrating a software-defined radio (SDR) inside an anechoic chamber which would 
                            act a low cost radio frequency signal
                            processor. IQ sampling was used to extact data from the SDR pertaining to the RF exposure.

                            The RF exposure monitoring station consisted of a simple monopole antenna that detects radio frequencies, a software-defined radio (SDR)
                            that processes the signals received, and a raspberry pi which runs code to find the RF exposure level from the IQ samples from the SDR.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The raspberry pi also ran code that sent the RF exposure data to a cloud-hosted time-series database where it was displayed on a browser-based
                            dashboard.
                        </p>
