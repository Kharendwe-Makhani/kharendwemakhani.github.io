                            In groups of four, we were tasked with designing, constructing and programming
                            an automated mechatronic system that can sort a collection of different coins according to their diameters.
                            The programming of the system was done using PLC ladder logic to control actuators.

                            The coin sorting system designed consisted of a piston cylinder hopper which acted as a magazine to store the
                            unsorted coins. When the piston cylinder pushes upwards, the coins exit the hopper and then slide on the sorting slide
                            which has filtering holes that filter the coins based on their diameters. The pneumatic cylinder then pushes the preliminary
                            storage containers with the sorted coins onto a lifting machanism that uses a Faulhaber motor. The coins in the preliminary
                            storage containers are then tipped over using strings attached to the DC motors to empty the coins to their respective final 
                            storage containers which are positioned using a stepper motor.

                            I was mostly responsible for the connection of wires from actuators to the PLC and the signal generator. 
                            I was also involved in the programming of the system while some of my teammates were busy constructing the physical
                            structure.
