							<h2>EPB Current Measurement System</h2>
						</header>
						<p>
                            As part of my vacation work at MellowVans I was tasked with creating a system that measures the amount 
                            of current it takes to fully engage an electronic parking brake (EPB) onto a brake disk. I did this by designing a 
                            circuit that included a a MellowVans I_SENSE logic control unit that was used to actuate a relay switch which acted 
                            as an easy way of electronically opening and closing the path for current flowing to the EPB. An ACHS-7123 current sensor 
                            was placed in series with the relay switch just before the EPB, 
                            this sensor was used to read the current being drawn by the EPB using an Arduino Mega 2560. For safety 
                            reasons, a 20A fuse was placed just after the current sensor to prevent excessive current from 
                            being drawn by the EPB when engaging on a load.

                            To complete the measurement system, brake 
                            pads were connected to the EPB, and a brake disc was placed in between them. After this, the 
                            EPB was actuated until the brake pads fully engaged on the brake disc, and the current was 
                            read off from an Arduino IDE monitor or terminal.
